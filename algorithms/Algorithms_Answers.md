Exercise I:
a. O(n) - > Correct
b. O(log n) - > Correct
c. O(n) - > O(sqrt(n))
d. O(n^2) - > O(n log n)
e. O(n^4) - > O(n^3)
f. O(n) - > Correct
g. O(n) - > Correct

Exercise II:
a. O(n):  You are starting at the first element of an already sorted array.  You're listing the same array.
b. O(log n):  It is sorting in a linear pattern, either left or right, but must travel down the tree to place the value.
